    Welcome to USA2KENYA.com, <%= @user.firstname %>!
    ==========================================

    We're so excited to have you as a customer at USA2Kenya. We started this company because of a problem we had and wanted to fix. Living in Kenya, we hated not being able to buy the things we wanted to online simply because retailers couldn't ship products to us. Now with USA2Kenya, you can order from anywhere online and receive your products in an affordable and timely fashion. 

    Getting started: To get the ball rolling, we need you to finish the registration process by visiting your account settings page at USA2Kenya.com and filling out the short form there. 

    Note that we require some form of government picture ID to ensure your security and prevent fraud. You can enter your National ID Card number, Passport ID or drivers license if a foreign national or other form of picture ID.

    This is necessary for clearing your products through the customs process, and without it we cannot ship any of your orders.
