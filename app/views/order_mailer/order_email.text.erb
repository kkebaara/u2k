Hi <%= @order.user.firstname %>,

Thanks for shipping your order with us. It's on its way to us to be handled with care & love by the Team at USA2KENYA.

The next steps for you:

  • Fill in the required customs information for the order

This consists of a short description of what you're shipping, it's monetary value (in US dollars), and the tracking number given to you by the original shipping merchant (e.g. a UPS tracking number).

This is necessary for clearing your products through the customs process, and without this detailed information on your orders we cannot ship any of your orders.

  • Fill in your required Personal Information.

Note that we require some form of government picture ID to ensure your security and prevent fraud. You can enter your National ID Card number, Passport ID or drivers license if a foreign national or other form of picture ID.
